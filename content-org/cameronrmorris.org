    Hi there. This is my first blog post. I've recently discovered Hugo and it
    fits nicely with my curiosity of markdown formats.

    A little bit about myself. I have been a software engineer at Amadeus for about
    3 years now. I work in the travel payments team. I enjoy bicycling, hiking and
    good food.

    I hope that this blog will bring some interesting things in the future. Until then.

    Cameron
