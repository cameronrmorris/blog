Hi there. This is my first blog post. I've recently discovered Hugo and it fits nicely with my curiosity of markdown formats.

A little bit about myself. I have been a software engineer at Amadeus for about 3 years now. I work in the travel payments team. I enjoy bicycling, hiking and good food. 

I hope that this blog will bring some interesting things in the future. Until then.

Cameron
